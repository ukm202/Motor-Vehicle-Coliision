# Motor-Vehicle-Coliision

    This project aims to examine traffic accidents around the
  area of Brooklyn Bridge in New York City. Utilizing available
  public datasets, our goal is to analyze vehicle collisions
  and their fatalities in association with a number of contextual
  elements, including the number of pedestrians, weather
  conditions, temperatures, and times of the day at which the
  collisions happened. This study using public data can provide
  insights into the relationship between such environment elements
  and the occurrences of traffic accidents in New York
  City. Based on the analytics of past events, the project can
  potentially allow for further analysis of hypothetical situations,
  assessing how likely a collision is given information
  on traffic as well as weather conditions in the area.
